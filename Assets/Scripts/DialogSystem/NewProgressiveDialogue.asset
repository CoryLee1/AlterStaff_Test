  - "You want to get out of here, don\u2019t you? Figures."
  - I used to train on this deck. Blade in hand, salt in my lungs. Thought strength
    could cut through fate.
  - "But the ocean... it doesn\u2019t care how sharp you are. Only how long you last."
  - If you want to survive, start paying attention. The ship remembers more than
    I do.
  linesWhen1Collected:
  - So you found that... I haven't touched it in years.
  - "\rOnce they gave me medals. Told me I was brilliant. Brave. Indispensable.\r"
  - "\r\rNow I'm just a ghost with too many stories and no one left to tell them
    to."
  - There's something buried in the gallery below. Go where the light used to shine.

    my bare hands, bleeding and laughing.\",\r"
  - "    \"It was behind the pipes... somewhere wet, somewhere forgotten. Like me.\",\r"

  - "Whatever you choose, don\u2019t forget me. I remember you already."
