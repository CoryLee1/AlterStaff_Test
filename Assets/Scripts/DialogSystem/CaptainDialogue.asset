  - Ah, a new face aboard my ship!
  - You look like you're lost, sailor.
  - This is MY ship, and everything on it belongs to ME!
  - Don't even think about touching anything!
  linesWhen1Collected:
  - Hey! I see you've been snooping around!
  - You found one of my precious items, didn't you?
  - Well, no matter. You'll never find them all!
  - My treasures are well hidden across this ship!
  linesWhen2Collected:
  - What?! You found TWO of my items?
  - You're more clever than I thought...
  - But don't get too confident, landlubber!
  - The most important things are still safely hidden!
  linesWhen3Collected:
  - Impossible! You found ALL my precious items!
  - You think you're so smart, don't you?
  - Well, even if you have those trinkets...
  - You'll NEVER escape this ship alive!
  keyLocationHintTemplate:
  - Ha! You want to escape, do you?
  - Well, you'll need the lifeboat key for that!
  - And I've hidden it somewhere very special...
  - It's in {keyLocation}, where you'll never think to look!
  - Good luck finding it before I throw you overboard!
  alternativeKeyHint:
  - Looking for a way off my ship?
  - The lifeboat won't do you any good without its key!
  - I've placed it {keyLocation}...
  - You'd have to be very lucky to stumble upon it!
