  keyLocationHintTemplate:
  - Ha! You want to escape, do you?
  - Well, you'll need the lifeboat key for that!
  - And I've hidden it somewhere very special...
  - It's in {keyLocation}, where you'll never think to look!
  - Good luck finding it before I throw you overboard!
  alternativeKeyHint:
  - Looking for a way off my ship?
  - The lifeboat won't do you any good without its key!
  - I've placed it {keyLocation}...
  - You'd have to be very lucky to stumble upon it!
